convert a decimal number to binary format
There are two ways :

Way 1 :

steps : 
1. divide the number by 2 .
2. store the remainder
3.repeat the above 2 steps until n!=0 .
4. reverse the answer 

convert the number 10 to binary 

Division	Remainder
10/2 = 5	0
5/2 = 2	    1
2/2 = 1	    0
1/2 = 0	    1

Now we need to reverse it : 
answer : 1010

Way 2 :

logic : num&1 (if the result  is 1 then the number is odd , if the result  is 0 then the number is even )


Example 5&1 = 0101
              0001
              0001 (which is 1)

Example 4&1 = 0100
              0001
              0000 (which is 0)

initialize one variable answer to 0 
answer = 0 ;
for first digit (bit)
answer = (10^0 * digit) + answer
answer = (10^1 * digit) + answer
answer = (10^2 * digit) + answer
answer = (10^3 * digit) + answer

here digit is the output (bit what we get in every iteration of n>>1)
