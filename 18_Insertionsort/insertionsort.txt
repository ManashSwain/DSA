Insertion sort is another simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time, taking each element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion.

It is adaptable and stable 

Time Complexity

    Best Case: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
    Average and Worst Case: O(n^2) when the array is sorted in reverse order.
    Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).
